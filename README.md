Synapse AI is a program to allow the creation of large multi-agent & multi-process AI.

through the useage of mutliple agents emergence of complex systems can arise through simple systems. 

Agents can be added through the agents folder and using the json format can be modified (any left out parameters will be loaded by the base_config.json)
Processes are currently in development and will be able to modify contents passed through 

With just these two types complex AI's can be created.

Note: the current goal is to create the baseline of synapse AI and then create an AI to modify the code for rapid feature implementation.
